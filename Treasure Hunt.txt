FULL STORY

While heading out to a rumored TREASURE site in the middle of the FOSSIL desert, our heroes run into some MAD MONKS blocking their progress. Within the arches and dunes they find a hidden ENTRANCE to a BURIAL ground haunted by ASTRAL spirits. After dodging the MONKS protecting the tombs, they discover a CRYSTAL MINE, surely the rumors they initially sought! But after plundering the VAULTS, they find a strange underground FUNGUS FARM, and at the edge of it, a large reinforced DOOR.

Once figuring out how to open it, our heroes stumble into a massive INDUSTRIAL complex that processes the fungus into a potent HALLUCINOGENIC and MIND-CONTROLLING substance. No wonder the MONKS are so fanatical in their drive to KILL! On their way through the facility, the MAD MONKS corner our heroes and capture them, imprisoning them in an ANCIENT temple of some kind. TEAMWORK and CLEVER THINKING get them out of their cells, through the halls, and out into the JUNGLE. It seems this TERRIBLE ORDEAL is behind them, but one falls into a deep PIT!

To rescue their fellow hero, the others must also go down into this MOSS CAVERN, where strange plants and DEVIOUS TRAPS await them. They reach a long underground LAKE, where a SUBMARINE conveniently awaits. Alas! Controlled by the MAD MONKS, the sub dives into the ALIEN REEF as soon as our heroes are onboard. They must wrest control of the sub, and use the TELEPORTER and PIPE NETWORK to traverse the AQUIFER back to dry land.

Here they find another GLITTERING CAVE and another ingredient in the HALLUCINOGEN: PHOSPHORUS. Our heroes courageously COLLAPSE the cave using explosives, but the blast opens a fissure deep into the earth. The IMPOSSIBLY DARK caverns they find themselves in offer no respite from the MONKS, and they must INGENUITY to navigate the MAZE and cross the INKY DARKNESS. Once back to the surface, however, they discover only ICE and DANGER, as they blast their way across the ANTARTIC. How will they ever return home?

After reaching a massive PIT at the SOUTH POLE, they discover the TRUE nature of the MAD MONK'S plan: to infuse the ENTIRETY of the EARTH'S MANTLE with their MIND-CONTROLLING CHEMICALS, leading every VOLCANIC ERUPTION to ENSLAVE the HUMAN RACE. Our heroes must stop this plot at all costs, braving LAVA and the most DEADLY MONKS to DESTROY the DEVICE meant to control every MAN, WOMAN, and CHILD and stop the MONKS once and for all.

After causing the MELTDOWN of the device, our heroes TELEPORT back to the desert where it all began, but they are PURSUED by a TEAM of MAD MONKS, set on REVENGE ...
